Esports is just like regular sports, but instead of kicking a ball or running on a field, players compete in video games. 

These players or teams are super skilled, and they play in organized tournaments or leagues, just like football or basketball players. 

It‚Äôs competitive gaming, with tons of fans watching live on streams or at big events! And just like traditional sports, players can win a lot of money from prizes, sponsorships, and streaming.
